# Background Context
## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! (The Holberton B&B)
** The Console **
### This is the first step towards building full web application: the AirBnB clone
### The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine. it's first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI that will be built later
   * create data model
   * manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
   * store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
    Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances

(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
